# Why TidyConsultant?

The TidyConsultant packages are designed in mind for consultants who frequently work with heterogenous small-medium sized tabular data sets and interact with the messy world of MS office. This package builds on prior art from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [officeverse](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/) and intends to provide useful functions for data scientists of any industry.

# Packages Overview

`validata`: understand the properties of a data frame. Which columns make the data frame distinct? Do 2 columns have a 1-1 mapping or 1-many mapping between values? What is overlap of unique values between 2 columns? Get quick summary of # unique, missing values, and a variety of properties of numeric columns.

`framecleaner`: simplifies common dplyr actions directly on a dataframe: automated type coercion, dealing with NAs, padding characters, creating dummies, importing files

`tidybins`: unified interface to creating and summarizing bins directly in a data frame

`presenter`: MS excel and powerpoint compatible output, with automated naming and formatting

`autostats`: simplified formula manipulation and modeling. Designed for quick exploratory analysis and visualization. 

## Installation and Loading

Loading `TidyConsultant` automatically installs and attaches the packages in the the *TC* universe.

You can install and load the released version of `TidyConsultant` along with `tidyverse` using the following code

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman"); library(pacman)

p_load(tidyverse, TidyConsultant)
```

This is a great template to start your R script. Put any additional packages you may need inside the
`p_load` command.
